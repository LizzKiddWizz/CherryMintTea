                    <p>
                        I am LizzKiddWizz! Just Lizz is fine! I am an artist, writer, and
                        game developer. I like to play video games with my friends, design 
                        characters, and write romance. My favorite types of characters are those 
                        who are good at heart, even if they make mistakes along their journey.
                        Anything else besides that, is too personal for someone I may not know.

                    <summary>What is this site?</summary>
                    <p>
                        A detailed archive of what I have written/logged for the various projects 
                        I have undertaken. There are character profiles, game bibles, devlogs, 
                        worldbuilding and even eventually links to completed works. It's essentially
                        my hub for everything I am developing. Though if you look I also have pages 
                        on my friends and what they're doing as well :)

                    <p>
                        It is a place for me to share my work with those I know, if it gets
                        out of my little circle, well, let's hope that won't happen.

                    <summary>Where should I start?</summary>
                    <p>
                        That's a pretty loaded question as I don't know myself, but the Vault with the most
                        content is under Meltdown. Go ahead and check it out underneath the

                    <summary>Is all of the information written here up to date?</summary>
                    <p>
                        I attempt to keep everything as current as possible, but if there are 
                        large enough edits over a long period of time, it may be a bit before
                        I can update the page. For that, just look at the top of any entry, if it
                        is being edited or changed, there will likely be a box at the top that will
                        let you know.

                    <summary>Is there a way to search for something specific?</summary>
                    <p>
                        No, unfortunately not, I'm a bit too lazy to undertake that. I'd suggest
                        bookmarking pages you want to frequently return to.

                    <summary>What is a Vault?</summary>
                    <p>
                        A Vault is where the rules, characters, and associated literature is located
                        for each established verse I have created. It helps keep things organized.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Why are some vault pages empty or “Coming Soon”?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Simple. I haven't actually started them yet, but they are planned!

                    <summary>How often is a Vault updated?</summary>
                    <p>
                        As a page or section is completed. Sometimes they require one another, so they have
                        to be added at the same time.

                    <summary>Where are the vaults for some of your listed projects?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Some projects are under the same vault as they are set within the same world. 
                        That is why some of the vault names don't have a matching project name.

                    <p>
                        Long-term Projects are what I am putting most of my effort into completing, or have
                        a lot of work tied to them, or cannot be completed within a short amount of time due to
                        either a lack of skill or resources.
                        Short-term Projects are things I am doing for fun or for other people, or even for work.
                        Guess you can say MAIN just means what I am PASSIONATE about. Side projects are also for 
                        fun, experimenting, or simply a way I can take a break from my other work.

                    <p>
                        No, I haven't even started yet. But if there is, it'll defnitely be linked on the project
                        page.

                        Yep! I'll try to post devlogs and concept art on a dedicated account linked on the main page.
                        If too many of my projects coincide though, I may have separate accounts per project.

                        Absolutely! Just make sure you send it to me, I want to see! (And if you post it, make sure
                        you say where it's from!)

                    <p>
                        Yes. Be respectful of myself and the characters, and try to be as accurate as possible within your means. Of course
                        it is okay to make AUs and to have alternate interpretations. I encourage that, it is amazing
                        to see how creative people can be. The issue doesn't lie with little physical changes, alternate events or a different sexuality. 
                        It is when characters' races, sex, origin, personality, or theming are far removed from their original depiction; not with the 
                        intent of exploring something new, but for some sort of gratification.
                        When it is purely self-serving and disrespectful to my work, I will ask for you to cease and remove what violated
                        my terms.

                        Yep! But I ask you to keep it within closed communities or adult spaces.
                        And mind the rules, be respectful of my characters and I. I'd rather you not
                        make my characters into fetish fodder.
