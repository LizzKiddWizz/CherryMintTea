                            just so happened to have hitched a ride with you too. Now you both have to escape together, and 
                            hopefully with Bellamy in one piece.

                            A strategy game built around managing the powers and struggles of infernal beings. You follow
                            Kane or Abelia, a young adult barely scrapping by in a hellish city, recently annointed as the owner
                            of a cursed grimoire. It sucks them into a corrupted scene and foists a responsibility upon them
                            to soothe the tattered mind the landscape represents. With a gothic aesthetic with hints of religious imagery you
                            trudge through a story focusing on finding faith in humanity and unraveling a plot against the very framework
                            of the universe.

                            This game centers around cooking and restaurant management. As well as building a relationship
                            with your clients through finding out their preferred meals via conversation and advice. The
                            main character is Beretta, a retiree whose children have grown and left her, dispersing throughout
                            the world and its vast continents. She finally has achieved one of her final dreams. A restaurant.
                            She has done everything in her power to attain this goal of hers, sometimes selfishly and in ways
                            she feels guilty about. In order to settle her heart (and gain some courage), she does her best to
                            redeem herself through good deeds and even greater food.

                            You are a young woman who has had their debutante in high society nearly half a year ago. It was merely a formality for
                            you, as you are already well-known amongst the nobles. Your engagement had been decreed by the King himself, and was
                            decided upon before you were even born. Since you are of age now, you are expected to marry soon and assist in the
                            household matters of your betrothed, and eventually bear several children. However, you have not met the man who will
                            become your husband. All you know, is that he is of high status worthy of your own, and that he is close in age to yourself.
                            This is a management and romance simulator where you attempt to rebuild your estate while nurturing your bond with your new
                            husband.
