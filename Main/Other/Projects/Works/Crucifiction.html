    Barely out of highschool and on the cusp of young adulthood, your parents oust you from their house
    to teach you the last and final lesson about what it means to be "grown-up". With only your savings
    acrued from summer jobs and allowances you struggleD to find an apartment close enough to your college
    that did not bankrupt you. It is dark, dank, and old smelling. You're pretty sure there is mold soaked
    into the damp walls of your room, and death gripping the leather couch that has been left untouched
    for decades. But you need this, it beats being homeless <i>and</i> helpless, especially in this city.
    While pitifully cleaning through the dilapidated cardboard boxes that line your new closet, you find
    a book in amazing condition. It's scent reminds you of your grandmother, smokey and nostalgic. You
    couldn't help but open it... to see what's inside.
