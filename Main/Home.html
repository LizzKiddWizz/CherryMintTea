                </header>

                <p>
                    Hiyah! My name is Lizz, also known as <span class="rasp">LizzKiddWizz</span>. I am an artist, a writer, and a soon to be developer.
                    My goal when creating is summarized by three words, Connection, Compassion, and Continuity. I want to create
                    connections, to concepts, to realizations, and most importantly, to people. I want to promote compassion, to
                    characters, to ideas, and to community. And lastly, I want to maintain continuity, in myself, the depictions
                    of the characters and what they represent, as well as in the environment the work exists in.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Though I believe that first and foremost, a book, a game, a movie, a <i class="rasp">story</i>, is meant to entertain, that
                    it should also leave you with something to think about. To improve upon, whether it be yourself, your relationships,
                    or your world, however big or small it is. Because that is how it sticks with you. I'd argue that much of what you
                    remember from your formative years are the people, and the content that you consumed. I know it shaped me, and likely
                    shaped you as well. And that is part of my intent, to leave an impact, and make something someone can remember fondly.

                        <p>
                            A strategy game built around managing the powers and struggles of infernal beings. You follow 
                            Kane or Abelia, a young adult barely scrapping by in a hellish city, recently annointed as the owner
                            of a cursed grimoire. It sucks them into a corrupted scene and foists a responsibility upon them
                            to soothe the tattered mind the landscape represents. With a gothic aesthetic with hints of religious imagery you 
                            trudge through a story focusing on finding faith in humanity and unraveling a plot against the very framework 
                            of the universe.

                        <p> 
                            This game centers around cooking and restaurant management. As well as building a relationship
                            with your clients through finding out their preferred meals via conversation and advice. The 
                            main character is Beretta, a retiree whose children have grown and left her, dispersing throughout
                            the world and its vast continents. She finally has achieved one of her final dreams. A restaurant.
                            She has done everything in her power to attain this goal of hers, sometimes selfishly and in ways
                            she feels guilty about. In order to settle her heart (and gain some courage), she does her best to
                            redeem herself through good deeds and even greater food.

                            A basket, within a basket, within a basket, within a basket. Near infinity. That is
                            what it means to be an Althalmus. To manage the sheer exxpanse of the multiverse, beyond your sense
                            of self, as it is your duty. Dante does not find this "duty" all that palattable. As he it is not as 
                            if he chose this fate that befell him. He simply died and was thrust into a position he cannot decline.
                            You help him navigate his training, meet interesting people, and face concepts unique to the environment
                            that is oh-so new to him. Explore. Document. Assist. Belittle. Love. Destroy. It is all up to you.
